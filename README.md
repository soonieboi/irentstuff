# Practise module repo
iRentStuff is an online rental service where users can post their used items up for rental.

## Defining the Problem Space & Current Landscape:

1. Item owners often own personal items but use them infrequently
2. Users may hesitate to purchase items due to cost, lack of storage space, or having no use for the specific item for a long period of time
3. Users have to explore multiple sites to list their items but the incumbent sites are not designed for rental market use
4. Growing interest in the sharing economy
5. Push to reduce waste
6. Giving items a new lease of life

## Gaps in the market/solution space today:

1. Lack of a dedicated platform for renting personal items
2. Difficulty in finding specific items for temporary use locally; many random platforms like gumtree, or carousell attempt to do this but the search and cataloging is not built for the specific use of renting

## User Archetypes Identified:

iRentStuff focuses on addressing the needs of two user archetypes identified: a. Item Owners - Individuals and/or Businesses that own items that are not frequently used 
b. Renters - Individuals and/or Businesses who need specific items on a temporary basis
